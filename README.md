# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 🗂️ Project Title
**Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Dataset (Sample Superstore)**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset. The aim is to uncover business insights from data on sales, profits, customers, and products using various visualization and statistical techniques. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ✅ Objectives

- Understand the distribution of sales, profit, and discounts.
- Analyze customer segmentation based on location and category.
- Identify high-performing product categories and regions.
- Detect patterns and relationships using multivariate plots.
- Provide recommendations based on data-driven insights.

## 🔍 Insights & Findings

- Some product sub-categories consistently lead to losses despite high sales.
- West region contributes the most to overall profit.
- High discounts often lead to reduced profits.
- Furniture category is underperforming compared to others.

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Re-evaluate discounting strategy, especially in loss-making sub-categories.
- Focus marketing on high-performing regions and customer segments.
- Explore bundling or phasing out underperforming products.
